            Hello there! I'm Tommy, and I'm in the process of making a
            significant career transition from retail to the thriving world of
            technology. Currently calling Surrey, B.C, Canada, my home, I've
            honed a keen knack for problem-solving and an insatiable thirst for
            learning.

            My expertise lies in full-stack development, with a strong
            proficiency in technologies like React and Node. I firmly believe in
            selecting the most suitable tools for each unique task. Presently,
            I'm channeling my skills and enthusiasm as a teaching assistant at
            BrainStation, where I find myself immersed in a myriad of
            exhilarating challenges.

            Beyond the world of coding, I relish the opportunity to explore
            Vancouver's picturesque landscapes alongside my wife. If you happen
            to cross paths with me on a Sunday, chances are I'll be savoring a
            delightful bubble tea üßã.
