          Hello there! I'm Tommy, and if it's not already evident, I'm embarking
          on quite the unique journey. I've made the transition from a
          background in retail to the bustling world of technology. Currently
          calling Surrey, B.C, Canada, my home, I've honed a keen knack for
          problem-solving and an insatiable thirst for learning.
        </p>
        <p className="about__text">
          My expertise lies in full-stack development, with a strong proficiency
          in technologies like React and Node. I firmly believe in selecting the
          most suitable tools for each unique task. Presently, I'm channeling my
          skills and enthusiasm as a teaching assistant at BrainStation, where I
          find myself immersed in a myriad of exhilarating challenges.
        </p>
        <p className="about__text">
          Beyond the world of coding, I relish the opportunity to explore
          Vancouver's picturesque landscapes alongside my wife. If you happen to
          cross paths with me on a Sunday, chances are I'll be savoring a
          delightful bubble tea üßã.

          into any topic or simply share a friendly chat. ü§ù
